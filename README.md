### Clinical-Longformer for Personalized Clinical Predictions
This repository contains code that implements a pipeline for fine-tuning the Clinical-Longformer model to predict personalized clinical outcomes from patient data. The model leverages clinical text to generate tailored predictions, enhancing patient-specific decision-making in healthcare settings.

### Overview
The code fine-tunes Clinical-Longformer, a transformer-based large language model pre-trained on clinical texts (e.g., MIMIC-III), to predict outcomes such as length of stay, readmission risk, mortality, or discharge disposition. It uses AWS SageMaker for scalable training and hyperparameter tuning, ensuring robust performance for personalized clinical applications.

### Key Features
Personalized Predictions: Analyzes patient clinical notes to suggest customized interventions, improving outcomes by tailoring recommendations to individual needs.
Long-Text Processing: Handles lengthy clinical documents (up to 4,096 tokens), capturing detailed patient histories critical for accurate predictions.
Flexible Prediction Tasks: Supports regression (e.g., length of stay) and classification (e.g., readmission risk) tasks, adaptable to various clinical goals.
AWS Integration: Uses SageMaker for efficient model training, hyperparameter tuning, and deployment, with S3 for data and model storage.
Evaluation Metrics: Includes comprehensive metrics (accuracy, F1, precision, recall for classification; MSE, MAE for regression) and confusion matrices to assess model performance.

### Prerequisites
Python: Version 3.10 (as used in the conda_pytorch_p310 environment).
AWS Account: Access to SageMaker, S3, and IAM roles for training and data access.
Dependencies: Install required packages listed in the notebook:pip install transformers==4.46.1 datasets scikit-learn sagemaker boto3 torch

### Hardware: GPU recommended (e.g., ml.g5.4xlarge instance in SageMaker) for faster training.

### Code Structure
The notebook is organized into several cells:
Setup and Dependencies:

Installs necessary libraries (transformers, datasets, scikit-learn, sagemaker, boto3, torch).
Updates SageMaker to the latest version.

SageMaker Configuration:

Configures AWS credentials and S3 paths for data, model, and manifests.
Example S3 paths for readmission model:
Training data: s3://keck-dev-transfercenter-data/length-of-stay/raw/2024_compiled_intake
Model output: s3://keck-dev-transfercenter-models/readmission/readmission_2024.tar.gz

Training Script Creation:

Defines a train.py script within the code/ directory, handling:
Dataset loading from JSON manifests.
Tokenization using Clinical-Longformer’s tokenizer.
Model fine-tuning for regression or classification tasks.
Custom metrics computation (e.g., MSE/MAE for regression, accuracy/F1 for classification).
Logging of confusion matrices and sample predictions with patient identifiers (FINs).

Creates a requirements.txt for SageMaker environment dependencies.

### Model Training and Tuning:

Initializes a HuggingFace estimator for SageMaker with Clinical-Longformer.
Configures hyperparameter tuning (e.g., batch size, epochs, learning rate) using Random or Bayesian strategies.
Supports multiple tasks (e.g., length-of-stay, readmission, discharge disposition) with task-specific configurations:
Regression: For predicting continuous outcomes (e.g., days in hospital).
Classification: For predicting categorical outcomes (e.g., readmission risk).

Saves the best model to S3 based on the objective metric (e.g., eval_f1 for classification, eval_mse for regression).

### How It Supports Personalized Care
The pipeline enables personalized clinical predictions by:

Processing Clinical Notes: Extracts insights from detailed patient records (e.g., diagnoses, symptoms, prior treatments) to tailor recommendations.
Predicting Optimal Interventions: Suggests specific actions based on individual patient profiles.
Adapting to New Data: Can be retrained with updated patient data to adjust predictions as conditions change.
Scalable Deployment: Integrates with clinical platforms via SageMaker, allowing healthcare providers to access real-time, patient-specific recommendations.

### Example Use Case
Input: Clinical note: “Patient, 65, admitted with pneumonia, oxygen saturation 92%, history of COPD.”
Model Output: Predicts “High readmission risk, 85% probability, recommend close follow-up.”
Provider Action: Implements enhanced monitoring and follow-up care based on the prediction.

### Usage Instructions
Prepare Data:
Store clinical notes in S3 (e.g., s3://keck-dev-transfercenter-data/).
Create JSON manifests (train_manifest.json, validation_manifest.json) mapping notes to labels (e.g., clinical outcomes).

Run the Notebook:

Execute cells in sequence to install dependencies, configure SageMaker, and create the training script.
Ensure AWS credentials are set up (IAM role: BaseNotebookInstanceEc2InstanceRole).

Fine-Tune the Model:

Specify the target model (e.g., readmission) and task type in hyperparameters.
Launch the SageMaker training job with the tuner to optimize hyperparameters.

Deploy and Predict:

Use the trained model (saved in S3) to predict outcomes for new patient notes.
Integrate predictions into a clinical platform for provider use.


### Notes
Data Privacy: Ensure compliance with HIPAA when handling patient data.
Model Fine-Tuning: Requires labeled clinical data for accurate predictions.
Scalability: Adjust SageMaker instance types (e.g., ml.g5.4xlarge) based on dataset size and computational needs.
Evaluation: Review confusion matrices and logged sample predictions
